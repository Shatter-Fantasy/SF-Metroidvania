# Install Process and things to know.

## Requirements

---
### Unity Version
This package was built with Unity 6 and newer version in mind. 
Most things will work out of box for older versions, but I will mainly focus on improving stuff for Unity 6 and newer editors.

### Unity Package Dependencies 
Before installing the SF Metroidvania do consider I rely on a couple of Unity's packages for performance, game mechanic systems, and so forth.
See linked page below to see the full set of Unity's Packages I used in making this and why they were used.
