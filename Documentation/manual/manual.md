# Manual Home

> The manual is being updated throughout June in preparation for the first full public alpha release.
> There will be times when I have to change the web url for better organization. If you want bookmark the site before it is ready I would bookmark this page.

> The API is still in alpha stages so some things might change like namespace or files being renamed. It is advised to use the main branch where I will only be merging the stable changes into it. 
> You can try the alpha branches if you want, but they might have commits pushed that could change things during the alpha stages very often.
